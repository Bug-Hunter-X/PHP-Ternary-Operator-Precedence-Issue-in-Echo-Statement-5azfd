The solution addresses the precedence issue by correctly parenthesizing the ternary expression to ensure the concatenation occurs as intended before the echo statement is executed.

```php
<?php
echo ($a = 10 ? 'Value is: ' . $a : 'Value is not set');
?>
```

By enclosing the entire ternary expression in parentheses, we force PHP to evaluate the ternary operator first, then perform the string concatenation, regardless of the condition's outcome. This ensures the correct behavior and intended output whether $a is set or not.
